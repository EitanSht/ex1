## Important to know:

1.  Eagles are some of the largest birds. They are at the top of the food chain, with some species feeding on big prey like monkeys and sloths.   Eagles have amazing eyesight and can detect prey up to two miles away.
2.  Eagles are birds of prey in the family Accipitridae; there are approximately 60 different species. The majority are found in Eurasia and Africa, with only 14 species found in other areas including North, Central and South America, and Australia.
3.  Sight is the strongest of all eagle senses. The eyes are large, can take up almost 50% of the head, and can weigh the same amount as a human eye. An eagles vision is 4â€“5 times better than that of a human. Eagle eyes are angled 30 degrees away from centre of the face, which gives eagles a greater field of view. Eagles can see five basic colours to our three, and can detect UV light.
4.  Cones are light detecting cells that are sensitive to colour. One of the reasons that eagles have better vision than humans is because their retinas, a layer at the back of the eyeball, have more cones. We have 200,000 cones per square millimetre, whereas eagles have one million.

## Mostly common in:
- The Upper Delaware River offers several eagle viewing spots, but be sure you don't disturb the birds if you go looking for them. These majestic birds can often be seen where creeks and other rivers meet the Delaware.
- A nearby Pennsylvania eagle viewing location, when the lake is not frozen, is Pennsylvania Game Commission's Shohola Recreation Area, off US Route 6.
- Good viewing with parking areas and public river accesses are at Callicoon and Narrowsburg, New York, and at Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania.
- To the north toward Hancock, eagles can also be seen at the Equinunk and Buckingham, PA, accesses.
- The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation maintains two well-marked viewing areas in the Mongaup Valley on the Rio and Mongaup Falls reservoirs (off NY Route 42). There is an information/observation booth at Mongaup Falls.
- Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area has several active winter eagle use areas: Milford Beach, Dingmans Ferry access, Bushkill boat access, and Smithfield Beach in Pennsylvania; and Kittatinny Point Visitor Center (on Interstate 80) in New Jersey.
